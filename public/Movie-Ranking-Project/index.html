<h1>The Best Movies According to Professor Filius Flitwick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Chronicles of Narnia</h3>
<p>As a series that opens the door to a magical land, it resonates with the hidden worlds within our own, much like the wizarding world.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>For its epic storytelling and the clear distinction between light and darkness, good and evil, which reflects the struggles we've faced in the wizarding world.</p>
<h3>Matilda</h3>
<p>This film celebrates the power of knowledge and learning, values that I hold dear as an educator.</p>
