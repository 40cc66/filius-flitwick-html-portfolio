    <title>About Professor Flitwick</title>

    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my little corner of Hogwarts! I am Filius Flitwick, part-goblin wizard and the Charms Master at this esteemed institution. My life’s work is dedicated to the art of charms, and I take great pride in nurturing the magical abilities of young witches and wizards.</p>

    <p>As a former duelling champion and a key participant in the Battle of Hogwarts, I have always stood for courage and resilience against dark forces.</p>

    <p>Beyond my duties as Charms Master, I serve as the Head of Ravenclaw House, where I foster an environment of learning and curiosity. My office door is always open to those in need of assistance or a friendly chat, and I’m known to offer a dance from my collection of enchanted cupcakes to those who visit in distress.</p>

    <p>In my pursuit of continuous learning, I am currently exploring the muggle world of technology and am enrolled in
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank"> Angela Yu’s web development bootcamp</a>. This fascinating study has opened my eyes to the parallels between coding and spellcraft — both require precision, creativity, and a deep understanding of the underlying principles.
    </p>

    <p>I look forward to sharing more magical moments with all who cross the threshold of Hogwarts.</p>
